## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Name of the Experiment

### 1. Story Outline:
A knuckle joint is a type of joint which connects two cylindrical rods whose axis lies on the same plane and are under a tensile load. It is used to transmit axial tensile force.
This joint allows angular movement of the two cylindrical rods in one plane.
Knuckle joint is named so as it uses a knuckle pin to join the two cylindrical rods.


### 2. Story:

Knuckle joint is used to connect two rods in which one rod has one eye end and the other rod has two eye end or the fork end. These ends are named one and two eye ends as one of these has one hole and the other one has two holes.
One eye end is placed between the two eyes of the two-eye end or fork end. After that a knuckle pin is inserted in the holes of the eye end and fork end. Knuckle Pin is used to hold fork end and eye end together. 

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Describe here : (guide When a user lands up into a simulator, the visual stage is the first thing that user comes across. The visual stage should include all the elements to be seen by a user on an imaginary canvas.  (This should NOT include any drawings. ) )

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

To create the 3D Assembly of Knuckle Joint in a 3D modelling design software by using different tools and techniques of Computer Aided Designing and Drafting. 

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

In this experiment, students will learn the basic orientation in basic 3D modelling tool transformations. Students should be made aware of the relevance of the technology they are studying to the real world. The study of technology and design enable students to put their learning into an authentic context, and so provide an additional resource that can add a new dimension to learning about technology and design in this field.



##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
The students will be able to design the knuckle joint parts and through this they also have an idea about how to assemble the different parts of it. This adds to the importance of creating new ways to train and teach built-environment professionals.

##### 4.Mindmap:

 Log on the system. 
 Open the 3d modeling cad software 
 Create the new part. 
 Generate the switches using entities and tool like circle, trim, move, etc.
 Edit the entities if necessary. 
 Using the features like pad, fillet, mirror, revolve, etc. 
 Save the part. 
 Similarly open a new part and complete the second part and save it. 
 Similarly, all parts are created and save. 
 Open the assembly part then open the all parts one by one. 
 Assemble the parts by using the tools. 
 Edit and save if necessary. 
 Exit the CAD software. 
 Log off the system.
