<b> About the Experiment :</b>

Knuckle joint is used to connect two rods in which one rod has one eye end and the other rod has two eye end or the fork end. These ends are named one and two eye ends as one of these has one hole and the other one has two holes.
One eye end is placed between the two eyes of the two-eye end or fork end. After that a knuckle pin is inserted in the holes of the eye end and fork end. Knuckle Pin is used to hold fork end and eye end together

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
    
<u> <b>Description: Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows:
    
Students will identify the various components as per the arrangement. With this, they will get concept and purpose of each component.
A knuckle joint is a type of joint which connects two cylindrical rods whose axis lies on the same plane and are under a tensile load. It is used to transmit axial tensile force.
This joint allows angular movement of the two cylindrical rods in one plane.
Knuckle joint is named so as it uses a knuckle pin to join the two cylindrical rods.
After performing the experiment, student shall give answer to the questions asked.
