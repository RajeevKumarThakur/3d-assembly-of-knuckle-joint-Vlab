1) knuckle joint is unsuitable for two rotating shafts, which transmit torque<br>
a) True<br>
b) False<br>

2) If knuckle joint is to fail by crushing failure of pin in fork, then determine the diameter of knuckle pin when 50kN axial tensile force act on rods. Given: Max allowable compressive stress=25N/mm², thickness of each eye of fork=25mm.<br>
a) 40mm<br>
b) 50mm<br>
c) 60mm<br>
d) 70mm<br>

3) A knuckle joint is also called socket pin joint.<br>
a) True<br>
b) False<br>

4) If any cross section is subjected to direct tensile stress and bending stress, then find the dimension of cross section. Given length & breadth are t and 2t respectively. F=25kN acts on the top fibre of the cross section, M=F x t . Also maximum allowable tensile stress =100N/mm².<br>
a) 25.5mm<br>
b) 30.2mm<br>
c) 27.55mm<br>
d) None of the mentioned<br>

5) A knuckle joint can be used in valve mechanism of a reciprocating engine.<br>
a) Yes<br>
b) No<br>
c) Yes but there are stress probles<br>
d) No as it is very dangerous to use<br>
