    <h3 align = "center">Background and Theory</h3>

    <p style="font-size:20px">A knuckle joint is a type of joint which connects two cylindrical rods whose 
        axis lies on the same plane and are under a tensile load. It is used to  transmit axial tensile
        force.This joint allows angular movement of the two cylindrical rods in one plane.
        Knuckle joint is named so as it uses a knuckle pin to join the two cylindrical rods.

    <h2>Knuckle Points Parts</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">
        <b>Functions of different parts: -</b><br>
        Knuckle joint is used to connect two rods in which one rod has one eye end and the other rod has two eye end or the fork end. 
        These ends are named one and two eye ends as one of these has one hole and the other one has two holes.One eye end is placed 
        between the two eyes of the two-eye end or fork end. After that a knuckle pin is inserted in the holes of the eye end and fork
         end. Knuckle Pin is used to hold fork end and eye end together Some part of knuckle pin comes outside of the lowermost hole of 
         the fork end. Knuckle pin has a small hole near its bottom. A collar and a tapper pin are used to lock the knuckle pin in the 
         eye and fork end. The collar has two holes in it and the collar is placed in such a way that hole of knuckle pin coincides with 
         holes of the collar and after that a tapper pin is inserted in the holes of the collar through the hole of knuckle pin. In this 
         way a knuckle joint is formed.

        <b>Advantages of using knuckle joint :-</b><br>
        <ol style="font-size:20px">
            <li>It can withstand large tensile loads.</li>
            <li>It has good mechanical rigidity.</li>
             <li>It can be easily dismantled and assembled</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Disadvantages of using knuckle joint :-</b><br>
        <ol style="font-size:20px">
            <li>This joint cannot withstand large compressive loads.</li>
            <li>Less flexible than universal joints</li>
            <li>Allow movement in only one plane.</li>
